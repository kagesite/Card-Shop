### About Project ###
This project is about how to use different HTTP requests. In this project, I learned how to use **app.get(), app.post(), app.put(), and app.delete().**

## How to use ##
### Step 1: ###
Go to token.http file and click on the 'Send Request' for the first http request. This will give you a auth. Token that will have to be copied and pasted for the next requests
