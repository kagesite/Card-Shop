### About Project ###
This project is about how to use different HTTP requests. In this project, I learned how to use ***app.get(), app.post(), app.put(), and app.delete().***

## How to use ##
### Step 1: ###
1. Start project using node app.js in the command line.
2. Connect to the server in the brower at http://localhost:3000/cards.
    ### Once connected: ###
    - You can start to search up, ?id="...", ?set="...", ?type="...".
    - If there is a problem, check spelling or capitalize first letters


### Step 2: /getToken ###
1. Go to **token.http** file and click on the 'Send Request' for the first http request. This will give you a auth. Token that will have to be copied and pasted for the next requests
